Mod inspired by Chino's Weapon Idea Short. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlRUgWmW4S8)

This mod features 5 new weapons, 1 advancement and a new armor item.

**Weapons**
- Copper Knuckles
- Iron Knuckles
- Golden Knuckles
- Diamond Knuckles
- Netherite Knuckles

**Equipment**
- Leather Slides

**Advancement**: "Ready for a Knuckle Sandwich?" - Obtain a netherite knuckle

Knuckles grant a 5% speed boost when equipped and they must be dual wielded (one on each hand) for them to deal damage, otherwise the damage is canceled if the item is held alone.

They also deal 1 more damage than their sword counterparts (excluding the copper knuckles as there's no sword counterpart for that), and deal more damage to armor and shields.

The leather slides grant a 20% speed boost but will take 1 armor point. (i.e. if you wear diamond armor, you will have 3.5 armor points instead of 4.)

To craft the knuckles, you need to place the materials as shown in the picture:

Unfortunately due to some weird error, it will only grant 1 knuckle when crafting it.

To craft the leather slides, it's the same recipe as the knuckles:

**Hope you like this mod, it was fun to make it!**
